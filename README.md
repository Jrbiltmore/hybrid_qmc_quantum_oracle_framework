# Quantum Monte Carlo and Quantum Oracle Hybrid Framework

## Overview

This framework is designed to integrate **Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods** with **Quantum Oracles** in a classical-quantum hybrid system. It combines the computational strengths of both classical and quantum processing to tackle complex problems, such as optimization, quantum chemistry simulations, and material science.

The framework is divided into three major layers:
- **Classical Layer**: Implements QMC methods for classical sampling, optimization, and subsystem simulation.
- **Quantum Layer**: Handles quantum circuit construction, oracle integration, simulation, and error mitigation.
- **Hybrid Interaction Layer**: Facilitates communication between classical and quantum systems, managing feedback loops, state translation, and iterative optimization.

## Key Features

1. **Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) Sampling**:
   - Classical subsystem simulation using Metropolis-Hastings and other QMC techniques.
   - Statistical error estimation and optimization based on QMC results.
   
2. **Quantum Oracle Integration**:
   - Build quantum oracles to solve specific problems like Grover's search, variational quantum algorithms, etc.
   - Design and simulate quantum circuits, applying oracle gates for hybrid computations.
   
3. **Hybrid Classical-Quantum Feedback**:
   - Seamless feedback loop between QMC and quantum circuits to optimize results iteratively.
   - Real-time state translation from classical to quantum and vice versa.

4. **Error Mitigation**:
   - Classical error mitigation with techniques like moving averages and outlier removal.
   - Quantum error mitigation with methods such as zero-noise extrapolation and error correction codes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Qiskit (for quantum circuit simulation)
- NumPy (for classical computations)
- SciPy (for optimization routines)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. To set up the environment automatically, run the setup script:
    ```bash
    bash scripts/setup_environment.sh
    ```

### Usage

1. **Classical QMC Sampling**: 
    - You can use the QMC sampling module in `/src/classical/qmc_sampling.py` to generate trial states or optimize classical parameters.

2. **Quantum Oracle Execution**: 
    - The quantum oracle module in `/src/quantum/quantum_oracle.py` builds and simulates quantum oracles for hybrid algorithms.

3. **Hybrid System Simulation**: 
    - Use the hybrid interaction modules to manage the feedback loop between classical and quantum parts. Simulate entire workflows with notebooks in the `/notebooks` directory.

### Running Tests

Unit tests are provided for all major modules. Run the tests with:
```bash
pytest /tests
```
